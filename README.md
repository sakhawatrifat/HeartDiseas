Project Name:- Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Python.

About

Heart disease prediction using machine learning is a valuable tool in healthcare that can aid healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

DataSet

The dataset has been collected from UCI Repository. It has come across 61 features which define and differentiate Heart Disease Prediction. This data is used for training and testing purpose. The Last column in this dataset indicates that, whether it's a mine or a rock, which is useful in prediction. The dataset is included in this repository.

Model

The model used here is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoid func. removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1. As it a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.

Lessons Learned

This is my first machine learning project where i learnt about logistic regression model which is used for binary classification.
I also learned about how different python libraries like scikit learn, numpy and pandas can be used to build and train the model.
Model evaluation using input data was also done in this project.
